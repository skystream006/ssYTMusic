# ssYTMusic

ssYTMusic is a Chromium WebView-based Android app dedicated to YouTube Music. It opens directly to `https://music.youtube.com/` with no address bar, keeps normal WebView cookies/history, blocks common ad and tracking requests, and provides an in-app settings panel for:

- mobile or desktop user agent mode dropdown
- system, light, or dark app theme dropdown
- video display default for showing the song thumbnail instead of available video
- an **Open supported links** shortcut to Android's settings for handling `music.youtube.com` links
- **Check for updates** using this repository's latest GitHub release
- back, forward, refresh, and home navigation
- optional debug logging
- a **Stats for nerds** overlay with live memory, network, and storage usage
- password-protected **Kid mode** for playlist-only listening
- browser-based **Login to Music Server** and playlist/song jobs for [ssYTDLP_Server](https://github.com/skystream006/ssYTDLP_Server)

System Back (button or gesture) and the settings Back button navigate through page history.
When no previous page is available, they open Home (Library in Kid mode) instead of exiting the app.

Kid mode, supported links, and Stats for nerds are grouped under **Advanced**, which starts
collapsed. **Logging** is a separate section, expanded whenever settings is opened with logging
enabled and collapsed otherwise. Tap either heading to expand or collapse its controls.
**View log**, **Share log**, and **Clear log** appear together in one row.

The YouTube Music wordmark in the page is replaced with the bundled ssYTMusic logo, which is served
to the WebView from a synthetic same-origin path instead of the network.

In the expanded media view, swipe down on the video area to compact the player, up to
open **Up next**, left for the previous song, or right for the next song. These gestures also work while the song
thumbnail is shown. Swipes are disabled on compact/minimized media and all other pages.
Taps and player controls retain their normal behavior.

The experimental **Compact player** shrinks the existing player page above the transport bar and exposes the
browse surface; **Expand player** restores its presentation. Dedicated native minimize/toggle
buttons use this app presentation while expanded. ssYTMusic does not replace/reload media, change
YouTube Music's internal player state, or resume an intentional pause. Track changes can continue
in compact mode while the same player remains expanded internally. If navigation changes that state,
the player is replaced, or fullscreen begins, compact presentation is removed rather than forcing
the site's state back. On unsupported page structures, the minimize icon retains its normal site
action and swipe-down clicks an available native minimize control instead. This fallback can trigger
the site's playback restrictions; it does not force playback to resume. Compact mode depends on
YouTube Music's DOM and is not a verified workaround for
site playback restrictions. Live YouTube Music was unavailable during development; checks used
a synthetic browser page, not the live site. Browsing/navigation may still trigger site playback
restrictions. Live playback, browsing, and restricted-content behavior require device verification.

## Supported links

To open YouTube Music links in ssYTMusic, expand **Advanced** and choose **Open supported links** in the settings
panel, enable the Android setting, and select `music.youtube.com` if prompted. Android 12+
opens the app's link settings directly; older devices (or devices without that screen)
open App info, where **Open by default** can be configured. Android requires user approval;
the app cannot silently make itself the default link handler.

## Music Server

In Preferences, choose **Login to Music Server** and enter your server's HTTPS
`PASSKEY_ORIGIN`, including its port (for example, `https://music.example.com:4000`).
Register a passkey and obtain account approval in the server's web UI first.
The address must be reachable from your phone and its certificate trusted by both
Android and your browser; ssYTMusic never bypasses TLS verification.

Login opens in your external browser for passkey authorization, then returns through
`com.ssytdlp.app:/oauth/callback`. If Android asks which app to use, choose ssYTMusic.
The server currently requires this shared callback scheme; another installed
ssYTDLP client may also claim it. PKCE protects the authorization code.
Login state and sessions are encrypted with Android Keystore-backed keys in
app-private, non-backed-up storage. If you close the browser without completing
login, choose **Cancel server login** in Preferences before trying again.

Once logged in:
- **Send current playlist to Music Server** sends the current page URL to
  `POST /api/jobs`. It only appears when the page has a nonempty `list` parameter,
  and updates while Preferences stays open.
- **Send current song to Music Server** reads the current player track and sends
  a standalone `https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=…` URL without playlist, radio,
  index, or tracking parameters, even when browsing another page during playback.
  Start a song first if no current player track is available.
- **Log out of Music Server** removes the saved login. Log in again to switch servers.

Expired or rejected sessions require a new browser login. Requests report success
or failure and are not automatically retried, avoiding duplicate jobs after an
uncertain network result. This login is separate from YouTube Music sign-in.

## Kid mode

Sign in first, then open **Settings → Advanced → Kid mode**. Enabling immediately asks
you to choose and confirm a non-empty password. Cancelling leaves the mode unchanged.
Turning it off requires that same password; an incorrect password keeps it locked.
Only a salted, slow password verifier is stored in app-private preferences, not the password.
The setting survives restarts. Keep the password safe: there is no in-app password recovery.

While enabled, launches, incoming links, and Home open
`https://music.youtube.com/library`. A Home button overlays the upper-left corner
only in Kid mode, letting you return to Library without opening Settings.
The page logo remains visible but is disabled
instead of redirecting. Open a playlist in the library before playing its songs.
The page's settings/menu buttons, navigation buttons, mini guide, search box, and Related
tab are removed. Autoplay is switched off and its section hidden and disabled.
Songs must be verified against the opened playlist, including when using notification
controls or skipping tracks; radio mixes and standalone song links are not allowed.

Kid mode requires a current Android System WebView with document-start script support.
It is an app-level restriction, not a device parental-control or explicit-content filter:
it does not rate songs, protect other apps, or prevent someone from clearing ssYTMusic's
Android app data. Restrictions depend on YouTube Music's page structure; if playlist
membership cannot be verified, playback is blocked rather than allowing an unknown song.

## App updates

The app and repository are now named **ssYTMusic**. The Android application ID remains
`com.skystream.ssmusic` so compatible, same-key APKs update existing installations rather
than installing a separate app. Internal preference, storage, and bridge identifiers are
unchanged to preserve settings, sign-in state, and logs.

Older builds still check the previous repository address and may reject GitHub's rename
redirects. If their update check fails, download the latest APK from the renamed repository's
releases and install it over the existing app once; do not uninstall and lose your app data.

On a fresh app launch, ssYTMusic checks the
[ssYTMusic releases](https://github.com/skystream006/ssYTMusic/releases/latest)
for a newer stable release and shows
**Update available to version {version}** when one exists. This automatic check does
not download or install anything.

Choose **Check for updates** in settings to check manually. If already current, a toast
shows **App is up to date with latest version {version}**. If behind, the app downloads
the release APK into its private storage, showing a progress bar and downloaded/total KB
below the update button, then opens Android's installer. Closing settings does not stop
the download; reopening settings shows its current progress. On Android 8+,
allow installation from ssYTMusic if prompted, then return to the app to continue.
Android requires your confirmation and a compatible signing key; updates are never
installed silently. Checking and downloading require an internet connection.

## Stats for nerds

Enable **Stats for nerds** under **Advanced → Diagnostics** in settings. The preference is saved, and
the touch-through overlay stays above the app content but below settings, so playback and
navigation remain usable. Settings can be scrolled on smaller screens.

Memory shows the current app process's proportional set size (PSS), excluding isolated
WebView renderer processes. Network shows download/upload rates for the app UID as reported
by Android, which may exclude traffic attributed to isolated WebView processes. The first
network sample and unsupported metrics display **Unavailable**, not a misleading zero.
Memory and network refresh approximately every second while the app is visible.
Storage counts app-private data and cache (including WebView storage), plus app-specific
external files/cache, not the installed APK or device-wide usage. It refreshes approximately
every 30 seconds on a worker thread. Sampling stops when disabled or the app is hidden.

## Logging

Logging is off by default. Expand **Logging** in settings and turn on **Enable logging**, then choose:

- **Full logging**: the existing 512 KB rotation with one backup.
- **Reactive logging**: keeps the latest 100 messages in one bounded file, dropping the oldest
  message with its entire stack trace. Switching to this mode trims the current file and removes
  the full-log backup. Exceptionally large entries are capped at 16,384 characters with an explicit
  truncation marker (at most about 4.7 MiB for 100 UTF-8 entries).

Both modes stay enabled until turned off and survive restarts; existing enabled installations
continue with full logging. Canceling the choice leaves logging off. Turn logging off and on
again to change mode.

Logging records app
activity — lifecycle events, navigation, permission decisions, blocked ad requests, playback
state, media notification commands, media-player swipes (direction, action, and whether the
control was clicked or unavailable), and uncaught exceptions. Every entry names the calling
code, and warnings, errors, and crashes carry a full stack trace. Entries go to logcat and to
a private log file (`files/logs/ssmusic.log`) managed by the selected mode. Use
**View log** to open a scrollable, selectable text snapshot in the app, with **Refresh** to
load newer entries. This also works with logging disabled for entries already saved. Use
**Share log** to send the file to another app and **Clear log** to delete it. Because the log
records visited YouTube Music URLs and track metadata, only share it with people you trust.

To diagnose swipes, enable logging, reproduce the gesture, then open **View log**. Native
touch reception and gesture rejection/cancellation are logged as well as completed actions,
so a gesture that never reaches the page's touch handlers is no longer silent.
Detailed gesture diagnostics also record native touch coordinates, pointer/move counts,
forwarding and handling results, and page touch/click delivery and default cancellation.
An asynchronous native hit test and page event hit tests describe nearby element tags,
bounds, visibility, and pointer-event state to help identify blocking overlays. A missing
window-bubble observation can indicate stopped propagation, but does not identify which
handler stopped it; a handled native event does not prove that a page action succeeded.
These diagnostics run only with logging enabled, omit page text, form values, IDs, classes,
and URLs, and do not cancel or synthesize gestures. Move events are counted rather than
logged individually.

The app requests the browser permissions YouTube Music may need, including camera, microphone, notification, and foreground playback permissions. When you send the app to the background, it keeps a low-priority playback notification active so music can continue playing.

Buffering keeps the playback service active, and pausing retains notification controls so you can
resume without reopening the app. Audio focus remains managed by WebView: calls and other audio
apps can still interrupt playback. Force-stopping the app or device-specific battery restrictions
can stop playback and remove its notification.

Instead of automatically confirming **Are you still listening?**, ssYTMusic refreshes the page
when the sixth song starts without user interaction, including while the app is in the background.
A native check every five seconds backs up song-start events while the app is not interactive.
Refreshing or interacting with the page,
app, or notification playback controls resets the count; pausing, buffering, and resuming the
same song do not count as new songs. A refresh uses the site's normal page-loading behavior
and may briefly interrupt playback.

## Build

```sh
./gradlew test assembleDebug
```

Builds require Git and a full-history checkout (`git fetch --unshallow` for an existing
shallow clone). `app/build.gradle` derives both Android version fields from the number
of first-parent commits after the fixed baseline commit `23d6b35` (version `0.10.02`,
code `36`). Each new commit on `main`, including a merged pull request, advances both
fields by one: the next version is `0.10.03`, code `37`. Patch and minor components
roll over at 100 (for example, `0.10.99` becomes `0.11.00`). Do not move the baseline
or manually bump the version fields.

GitHub Actions tests and builds debug APK artifacts and reads the version from the
built APK metadata, so the app, artifact name, and release tag agree.
The **Android APK** workflow runs on pushes to `main`, pull requests, and manual
dispatches. It only tests, builds, and uploads APK artifacts; it does not publish
GitHub releases automatically after merges.

To build a release manually, open **Actions → Manual Android Release → Run workflow**.
This separate, manual-only workflow always checks out the latest `main` and uses its
Git-derived version without incrementing it again. Rebuilding the same commit uses
the same version in either workflow. It runs tests,
uploads a debug-signed `ssYTMusic-v<versionName>.apk` artifact, and publishes a new release tagged
`v<versionName>` with generated release notes, marked as latest.
If that version's release already exists, it is left unchanged; the rebuilt APK is
still available in the workflow artifacts. Merge new changes into `main` when you
need a new release. Pull request artifact versions are previews, not reserved release
versions; the final version is calculated from the merged commit on `main`.
